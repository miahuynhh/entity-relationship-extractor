Cursor would forget that part of the task was to make an interactive web page.
It built the backend, and through revision with me, it fine-tuned it to work pretty
well, but the coding agent completely forgot about building the front end. Once I 
remindeded it, it did a pretty decent job. It still failed to organize the Entity 
Relationship Graph in a way that is easily readable for humans - the arrow tips are too
big, the lines are too short, the text is sometimes upside-down. However, Cursor did make
the graph interactive, so that the entities can be clicked on and dragged around to make
the text on the lines more legible.
