# Frontend Development Blueprint: Entity Relationship Visualizer

## Project Overview
Build an interactive web application with Python backend that allows users to explore entities and relationships in free-form text. The interface has two main components:
- **Left panel**: Text input area for arbitrary free-form text
- **Right panel**: Dynamic visualization area displaying entities and their relationships

## Technology Stack
- **Backend**: Python Flask (lightweight, easy to integrate with existing code)
- **Frontend**: HTML5, CSS3, JavaScript (vanilla for simplicity)

## Detailed Step-by-Step Implementation Plan

---

## Phase 1: Basic Web Server Setup

### Step 1.1: Create Flask Web Server
**Goal**: Set up a basic Flask server that can serve HTML pages and handle API requests.

**Context**: We need to create a web server that can serve our frontend and provide API endpoints for the existing backend functionality.

**Prompt**:
```
Create a Flask web server in src/app.py that:
1. Serves static HTML files from a 'templates' directory
2. Has a root route '/' that serves index.html
3. Includes CORS support for frontend-backend communication
4. Has a basic API endpoint '/api/health' that returns {'status': 'ok'}
5. Uses the existing enhanced_relationship_extractor module
6. Includes proper error handling and logging

The server should be able to run on localhost:5000 and integrate with our existing backend modules.
```

### Step 1.2: Create Basic HTML Structure
**Goal**: Create the basic HTML structure with left and right panels as specified.

**Context**: We need a clean, responsive layout with two main panels for text input and visualization.

**Prompt**:
```
Create src/templates/index.html with:
1. A two-panel layout (left: text input, right: visualization)
2. Left panel: textarea for text input with placeholder text
3. Right panel: div container for graph visualization
4. A "Analyze Text" button to trigger analysis
5. Basic responsive design using CSS Grid
6. Include D3.js library from CDN
7. Link to external CSS and JS files

The layout should be clean, professional, and ready for styling.
```

### Step 1.3: Basic CSS Styling
**Goal**: Style the application with a modern, clean design.

**Context**: We need professional styling that makes the interface intuitive and visually appealing.

**Prompt**:
```
Create src/static/styles.css with:
1. Modern, clean design with a professional color scheme
2. Two-panel layout using CSS Grid (50/50 split)
3. Styled textarea with proper sizing and borders
4. Styled button with hover effects
5. Responsive design that works on different screen sizes
6. Loading states and visual feedback
7. Professional typography and spacing

Use a color scheme that's easy on the eyes and professional.
```

## Phase 2: Backend API Integration

### Step 2.1: Create Analysis API Endpoint
**Goal**: Create an API endpoint that accepts text input and returns relationship data.

**Context**: We need to connect the frontend to our existing backend functionality through a REST API.

**Prompt**:
```
Extend src/app.py to add:
1. POST endpoint '/api/analyze' that accepts JSON with 'text' field
2. Integration with existing enhanced_relationship_extractor
3. Error handling for invalid input and processing errors
4. Returns JSON response with entities and relationships
5. Proper HTTP status codes (200, 400, 500)
6. Input validation and sanitization
7. Logging for debugging

The endpoint should use our existing backend modules and return data in a format suitable for frontend visualization.
```

### Step 2.2: Test API Integration
**Goal**: Ensure the API works correctly with the existing backend.

**Context**: We need to verify that our Flask server can properly use the existing relationship extraction functionality.

**Prompt**:
```
Create src/test_api.py to:
1. Test the Flask server startup
2. Test the /api/analyze endpoint with sample text
3. Verify response format matches frontend expectations
4. Test error handling with invalid inputs
5. Ensure CORS headers are properly set
6. Test with the Casey Stengel sample text

This should be a simple test script that validates our API works correctly.
```

2. Event listener for the analyze button
3. Function to get text from textarea
4. Function to make API call to /api/analyze
5. Basic error handling and user feedback
6. Loading state management
7. Function to clear previous results

The code should be well-structured, commented, and ready for visualization integration.
```

### Step 3.2: API Communication Layer
**Goal**: Create a robust communication layer between frontend and backend.

**Context**: We need reliable API communication with proper error handling and user feedback.

**Prompt**:
```
Extend src/static/app.js to add:
1. Async/await API call function with proper error handling
2. Loading spinner/indicator during API calls
3. Success and error message display
4. Input validation before sending requests
